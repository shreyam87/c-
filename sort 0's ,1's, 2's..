/* Here we use the 3-pointers approach or Dutch National Flag Algorithms....
What is the Dutch National Flag Algorithm?
---> The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors Red, White, and Blue. 
Since our input array consists of three different numbers
that is  why it is called the Dutch National Flag Algorithm..
